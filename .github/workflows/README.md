# Staff Management CI/CD Workflow Instructions

This document provides comprehensive instructions for the CI/CD pipeline setup and usage for the Staff Ma- `StaffManagement.Web/package.json` - Node.js dependencies (React 19.1, MUI, etc.)
- `StaffManagement.Web/package-lock.json` - Locked dependency versions
- `StaffManagement.E2E/package.json` - Playwright E2E test dependencies
- `*.csproj` files - .NET project configurations (.NET 8.0)
- `StaffManagement.sln` - Solution file containing all projectsent project.

## üìã Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the Staff Management application whenever code is pushed to the repository. The pipeline consists of several jobs that run in parallel and sequence to ensure code quality and successful deployment.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The Staff Management system is a modern web application with the following components:

- **StaffManagement.Api**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 Web API backend
- **StaffManagement.Web**: React 19.1 frontend with MUI (Material-UI)
- **StaffManagement.APP.Logic**: Business logic layer with Entity Framework
- **StaffManagement.SharedLib**: Shared models, DTOs, helpers, and utilities
- **StaffManagement.Tests**: Unit and integration tests with xUnit
- **StaffManagement.E2E**: Playwright end-to-end tests

## üöÄ Pipeline Jobs

### 1. Backend Testing (`test-backend`)
- **Purpose**: Validates .NET API and business logic
- **Actions**:
  - Restores NuGet dependencies
  - Builds the entire solution (including API, Logic, SharedLib, and Tests projects)
  - Runs all unit and integration tests
- **Requirements**: .NET 8.0.x (configured in workflow)
- **Projects Tested**: 
  - StaffManagement.Api
  - StaffManagement.APP.Logic
  - StaffManagement.SharedLib
  - StaffManagement.Tests

### 2. Frontend Testing (`test-frontend`)
- **Purpose**: Validates React application
- **Actions**:
  - Installs npm dependencies using `npm ci`
  - Builds the React application for production
- **Requirements**: Node.js 18.x
- **Technologies**: React 19.1, MUI (Material-UI)
- **Coverage**: Builds application to verify functionality

### 3. End-to-End Testing (`e2e-tests`)
- **Purpose**: Tests the complete application flow
- **Actions**:
  - Starts the .NET API server on port 5009
  - Starts the React development server on port 3000
  - Runs Playwright E2E tests
  - Uploads test reports as artifacts
- **Dependencies**: Requires both backend and frontend tests to pass
- **Health Checks**: Validates both services are running before testing

### 4. Security Scanning (`security-scan`)
- **Purpose**: Scans for vulnerabilities in the codebase
- **Actions**:
  - Runs Trivy vulnerability scanner on filesystem
  - Uploads results to GitHub Security tab in SARIF format
- **Runs**: In parallel with other tests
- **Coverage**: Scans all project files for known vulnerabilities

### 5. Deployment (`deploy`)
- **Purpose**: Creates deployment artifacts for production
- **Actions**:
  - Builds optimized production versions of both backend and frontend
  - Creates deployment package with both components
  - Uploads artifacts for download
- **Trigger**: Only runs on `main` branch after all tests pass
- **Artifacts**: 
  - Backend: Published .NET application
  - Frontend: Optimized React build with production settings

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Repository Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure your repository has the following structure:
   StaffManagement/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.sln
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.Api/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.APP.Logic/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.SharedLib/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.Web/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.Tests/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.E2E/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ local-cicd.bat
   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ local-cicd.sh
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
   ```

2. **Branch Protection**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches in your GitHub repository
   - Add branch protection rule for `main`
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require pull request reviews

### Environment Variables

The pipeline uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` | API base URL for React app | `http://localhost:5009` (dev), `/api` (prod) |
| `CI` | Indicates CI environment | `true` |

### Required Secrets

No secrets are required for the basic pipeline. For deployment to specific platforms, you may need to add:

- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` (for Azure deployment)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (for AWS deployment)
- `DEPLOY_TOKEN` (for custom deployment endpoints)

## üìù Configuration Files

### 1. Main Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

The main CI/CD pipeline configuration. Key sections:

```yaml
# Triggers
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# Jobs run in Ubuntu environment
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

### 2. Package Files

Ensure these files are present and up-to-date:

- `StaffManagement.Web/package.json` - Node.js dependencies (React 19.1, MUI, etc.)
- `StaffManagement.Web/package-lock.json` - Locked dependency versions
- `StaffManagement.E2E/package.json` - Playwright E2E test dependencies

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Failures

**Symptom**: `dotnet build` fails
**Solutions**:
- Check for missing NuGet packages: `dotnet restore`
- Verify .NET version compatibility
- Check for syntax errors in C# code

#### 2. Frontend Build Failures

**Symptom**: `npm run build` fails
**Solutions**:
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install`
- Check for TypeScript/JavaScript errors in the console
- Verify environment variables are set correctly (REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL)
- Ensure React 19.1 compatibility with all dependencies

#### 3. E2E Test Failures

**Symptom**: Playwright tests fail or timeout
**Solutions**:
- Verify both API (port 5009) and frontend (port 3000) are running
- Check for port conflicts with other applications
- Review Playwright configuration in `StaffManagement.E2E/playwright.config.js`
- Ensure proper health check endpoints are responding
- Check network connectivity between services

#### 4. Security Scan Issues
