# Staff Management CI/CD Workflow Instructions

This document provides comprehensive instructions for the CI/CD pipeline setup and usage for the Staff Management project.

## üìã Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the Staff Management application whenever code is pushed to the repository. The pipeline consists of several jobs that run in parallel and sequence to ensure code quality and successful deployment.

## üöÄ Pipeline Jobs

### 1. Backend Testing (`test-backend`)
- **Purpose**: Validates .NET API and business logic
- **Actions**:
  - Restores NuGet dependencies
  - Builds the entire solution
  - Runs all unit and integration tests
- **Requirements**: .NET 9.0.x

### 2. Frontend Testing (`test-frontend`)
- **Purpose**: Validates React application
- **Actions**:
  - Installs npm dependencies
  - Runs Jest tests with coverage
  - Builds the React application
- **Requirements**: Node.js 18.x

### 3. End-to-End Testing (`e2e-tests`)
- **Purpose**: Tests the complete application flow
- **Actions**:
  - Starts the .NET API server
  - Starts the React development server
  - Runs Playwright E2E tests
  - Uploads test reports as artifacts
- **Dependencies**: Requires both backend and frontend tests to pass

### 4. Security Scanning (`security-scan`)
- **Purpose**: Scans for vulnerabilities
- **Actions**:
  - Runs Trivy vulnerability scanner
  - Uploads results to GitHub Security tab
- **Runs**: In parallel with other tests

### 5. Deployment (`deploy`)
- **Purpose**: Creates deployment artifacts
- **Actions**:
  - Builds optimized production versions
  - Creates deployment package
  - Uploads artifacts for download
- **Trigger**: Only runs on `main` branch after all tests pass

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Repository Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure your repository has the following structure:
   StaffManagement/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.sln
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.Api/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.Web/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.Tests/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ StaffManagement.E2E/
   ```

2. **Branch Protection**:
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Branches in your GitHub repository
   - Add branch protection rule for `main`
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require pull request reviews

### Environment Variables

The pipeline uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL` | API base URL for React app | `http://localhost:5009` (dev), `/api` (prod) |
| `CI` | Indicates CI environment | `true` |

### Required Secrets

No secrets are required for the basic pipeline. For deployment to specific platforms, you may need to add:

- `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` (for Azure deployment)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (for AWS deployment)
- `DEPLOY_TOKEN` (for custom deployment endpoints)

## üìù Configuration Files

### 1. Main Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`)

The main CI/CD pipeline configuration. Key sections:

```yaml
# Triggers
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# Jobs run in Ubuntu environment
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

### 2. Package Files

Ensure these files are present and up-to-date:

- `StaffManagement.Web/package.json` - Node.js dependencies
- `StaffManagement.Web/package-lock.json` - Locked dependency versions
- `*.csproj` files - .NET project configurations
- `StaffManagement.sln` - Solution file

## üß™ Testing Locally

### Using the Local CI/CD Script

Run the complete pipeline locally:

**Windows:**
```cmd
.\scripts\local-cicd.bat
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/local-cicd.sh
./scripts/local-cicd.sh
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Backend Tests**:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore StaffManagement.sln
   dotnet build StaffManagement.sln
   dotnet test StaffManagement.Tests/StaffManagement.Tests.csproj
   ```

2. **Frontend Tests**:
   ```bash
   cd StaffManagement.Web
   npm ci
   npm test -- --watchAll=false
   npm run build
   ```

3. **E2E Tests**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start API
   dotnet run --project StaffManagement.Api/StaffManagement.Api.csproj
   
   # Terminal 2: Start React app
   cd StaffManagement.Web && npm start
   
   # Terminal 3: Run E2E tests
   cd StaffManagement.E2E && npx playwright test
   ```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Build Failures

**Symptom**: `dotnet build` fails
**Solutions**:
- Check for missing NuGet packages: `dotnet restore`
- Verify .NET version compatibility
- Check for syntax errors in C# code

#### 2. Frontend Build Failures

**Symptom**: `npm run build` fails
**Solutions**:
- Delete `node_modules` and run `npm ci`
- Check for TypeScript/JavaScript errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly

#### 3. E2E Test Failures

**Symptom**: Playwright tests fail or timeout
**Solutions**:
- Verify both API and frontend are running
- Check port conflicts (API: 5009, React: 3000)
- Review Playwright configuration in `StaffManagement.E2E/`

#### 4. Security Scan Issues

**Symptom**: Trivy scan fails or reports vulnerabilities
**Solutions**:
- Update dependencies to latest secure versions
- Review and acknowledge acceptable risks
- Add vulnerability exceptions if needed

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Workflow Logs**:
   - Go to Actions tab in GitHub
   - Click on failed workflow run
   - Expand failed job steps

2. **Local Debugging**:
   ```bash
   # Enable verbose logging
   dotnet build --verbosity detailed
   npm run build -- --verbose
   ```

3. **Dependency Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Clear all caches
   dotnet clean
   rm -rf StaffManagement.Web/node_modules
   rm StaffManagement.Web/package-lock.json
   
   # Reinstall
   dotnet restore
   cd StaffManagement.Web && npm install
   ```

## üì¶ Deployment Artifacts

After successful pipeline execution, the following artifacts are created:

### Backend Artifact
- **Location**: `deployment/backend/`
- **Contents**: Published .NET application
- **Usage**: Deploy to IIS, Docker, or cloud hosting

### Frontend Artifact
- **Location**: `deployment/frontend/`
- **Contents**: Optimized React build
- **Usage**: Deploy to static hosting (Nginx, Apache, CDN)

### Download Artifacts

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Click on successful workflow run
3. Scroll down to "Artifacts" section
4. Download `deployment-files.zip`

## üîÑ Workflow Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

- **Push to `main`**: Full pipeline + deployment
- **Push to `develop`**: Full pipeline (no deployment)
- **Pull Request to `main`**: Full pipeline (no deployment)

### Manual Triggers

You can manually trigger the workflow:

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Select "Staff Management CI/CD"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose branch and click "Run workflow"

## üìä Monitoring and Reporting

### Test Results
- Unit test results appear in workflow logs
- Coverage reports are generated for frontend tests
- E2E test reports are uploaded as artifacts

### Security Reports
- Vulnerability scans are uploaded to Security tab
- SARIF format reports for integration with GitHub Security

### Performance Monitoring
- Build times are tracked in workflow logs
- Artifact sizes are reported
- Test execution times are measured

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Test Steps

```yaml
- name: Custom Test Step
  run: |
    echo "Running custom tests..."
    # Your custom test commands
```

### Modifying Build Configuration

Edit `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`:

```yaml
# Change .NET version
- name: Setup .NET
  uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
  with:
    dotnet-version: '9.0.x'  # Update version here

# Change Node.js version
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'  # Update version here
```

### Adding Deployment Targets

```yaml
# Example: Deploy to Azure
- name: Deploy to Azure
  if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
  uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
  with:
    app-name: 'your-app-name'
    publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
    package: './deployment'
```
